Title: Assess Gene Predictions Using Proteomics and Evolutionary Conservation
Version: 0.99.9

Description: In order to assess the quality of a set of predicted genes for a genome, evidence
    must first be mapped to that genome. Next, each gene must be categorized based on how strong
    the evidence is for or against that gene. The AssessORF package provides the functions and
    class structures necessary for accomplishing those tasks, using proteomic hits and
    evolutionarily conserved start codons as the forms of evidence.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0), DECIPHER (>= 2.8.0)
Imports: DECIPHER, graphics
Suggests: BiocStyle,
    knitr,
    rmarkdown
biocViews: ComparativeGenomics, GenePrediction, GenomeAnnotation, Genetics, Proteomics,
    QualityControl, Visualization
